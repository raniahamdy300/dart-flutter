// - An integer named age with a value of 25.
// - A double named height with a value of 5.9.
// - A string named name with a value of "Dart Programmer".

// Goal: Understand variable declaration and Dart's type system.

void main() {
  int age = 25;
  double hight = 5.9;
  String name = 'Dart Programmer';
  print('your name is $name, your are $age and your hight = $hight');
